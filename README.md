<h4>
Today in 20th day, I learned about how to write a clean code that makes code easily understandable when number of people increase in team for any project, following some specific guidelines. For example :- using camelCase for variables and functions, variable name starting with letter, using arrow functions instead of regular function declaration, making array names plural, etc.
