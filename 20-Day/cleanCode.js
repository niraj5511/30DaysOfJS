// Writing clean code

// Need of style guide
/*
It does not matter in anyway you write you code as long as it running,
however when you work in team of 10 or 20 or more developer on one project
and on the same code base, the code will be messy and hard to manage if there
is no any guidelines to follow.

// Conventions used in this challenge
/*
We used camelCase for variables and functions.
All variable names start with a letter.
We chose to use const for constants, arrays, objects and functions. In stead of double quote, we chose to use single quote or backtick. Single quote is becoming trendy.
We also removed semicolons from our code but it is a matter of personal preference.
Space around arithmetic operators, assignment operators and after comma
Arrow function instead of function declaration
Explicit return instead of implicit return if the function is one liner
No trailing comma in the last value of an object
We prefer this +=, -=, = /=, *= instead of the longer version
When we use console.log() it is good to print with a tag string to identify from where the console is coming
